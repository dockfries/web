## First release of open.mp launcher
Please note you still need samp installed to play, you can install samp from https://sa-mp.mp/downloads/ and then open open.mp launcher to enjoy a live, reliable, and populated server list to find any server you want to play on!

Many more features will be available in future and directly built into the launcher in future versions

## Installation
You can choose whether you want the portable versions or install it normally like any other application, in your desired path. For portable version, you can just download **omp-launcher.exe**, the other two are installers, you choose whatever you want.
