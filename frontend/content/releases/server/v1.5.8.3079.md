## What's changed

### Major Features
- Introdued **fully controllable NPCs as a built-in server feature**, removing the need for external NPC plugins and enabling deeper server-side AI and automation.
- Added a **C API and C API SDK**, allowing developers to integrate open.mp directly with native code and external tooling.
- Added the ability to **call Pawn natives from the open.mp C++ SDK**, significantly improving interoperability between scripting and native modules.

### Networking & Performance
- Significant **network performance improvements**, resulting in faster synchronization and more responsive gameplay.
- Added multiple **sync validation checks** to prevent invalid data, spoofed states, and malformed packets.
- MTU values are now **validated against the maximum allowed per client version**, preventing misconfiguration and instability.

### Platform & Compatibility
- Upgraded **OpenSSL from 1.1.1 to 3.0.13**, officially deprecating legacy Linux distributions and ensuring proper support for modern systems.
- Added **environment variable support for `config.json`**, making containerized, CI/CD, and production deployments easier and more flexible.

### NPC & Gameplay Improvements
- NPC IDs now allocate from **highest to lowest**, preventing conflicts and improving predictability.
- Deprecated `ConnectNPC` in favor of the new built-in NPC system.
- Forced train creation to always use **4 consecutive IDs**, fixing long-standing inconsistencies.
- Fixed train passenger synchronization issues.

### Stability & Bug Fixes
- Fixed an infamous issue with spawn data
- Fixed kick delay issues.
- Fixed crashes related to gangzones in the checking list during server restarts.
- Fixed random occurrences of player state being set to `None` after spectating.
- Fixed stdin lock on Linux during server shutdown.
- Fixed `chatlogging` not affecting death messages.
- Removed the legacy **Fixes** component due to instability, redundancy, and its functionality being superseded by newer systems.
- Numerous small Pawn native fixes for improved correctness and usability.
