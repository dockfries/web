## Out of RC
open.mp is now out of RC phase, and we are happy to announce we are finally stable enough to go down the consistent development road. with v1.1.0.2612, we fixed a lot of bugs and issues, and resolved so many behavior differences. so make sure you update to latest builds and run your server smoothly.

## Launcher, first step towards client.
open.mp launcher is finally out, you can now reliably browse servers, select a server you want to play on, and join it!
Bringing a lot of new features into it, you're going to have a much better experience compared to old experience you always had to have with samp launcher.
It can be found at https://github.com/openmultiplayer/launcher
