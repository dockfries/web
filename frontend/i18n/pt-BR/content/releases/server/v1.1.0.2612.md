## Saiu do RC
O open.mp agora saiu da fase RC, e temos o prazer de anunciar que finalmente estamos estáveis o suficiente para seguir o caminho de desenvolvimento consistente. Com a v1.1.0.2612, corrigimos muitos bugs e problemas, e resolvemos diversas diferenças de comportamento. Então certifique-se de atualizar para as versões mais recentes e rodar seu servidor sem problemas.

## Launcher, primeiro passo rumo ao cliente.
O launcher do open.mp finalmente foi lançado, agora você pode navegar pelos servidores de forma confiável, selecionar um servidor em que deseja jogar e entrar nele!
Trazendo muitas funcionalidades novas, você terá uma experiência muito melhor em comparação com a experiência antiga que sempre teve com o launcher do SA-MP.
Ele pode ser encontrado em https://github.com/openmultiplayer/launcher
